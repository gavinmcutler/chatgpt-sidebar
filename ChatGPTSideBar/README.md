# ChatGPT Sidebar for Windows

ChatGPT Sidebar is a Windows-only desktop utility that integrates the ChatGPT web application into a docked panel on your desktop.  
Unlike a standard floating window, it registers itself with the Windows AppBar API, reserving space on the edge of the screen and behaving like a built-in system panel.  
The goal is to make ChatGPT feel like a native part of the operating system rather than a separate application.

## Features

- **Docked Sidebar**  
  Runs as a Windows AppBar, docking to the left or right edge of the screen. Other windows automatically resize around it.

- **Embedded ChatGPT Web App**  
  Displays the ChatGPT web client inside a `QWebEngineView`, avoiding the need for a browser tab.

- **Persistent Configuration**  
  Remembers width, edge (left/right), and docked/undocked state across sessions.

- **Theme Integration**  
  Matches the system light/dark mode for a cohesive appearance.

- **Screenshot-to-Chat**  
  Captures another application window and inserts the screenshot directly into the ChatGPT composer.  
  - Works without writing files to disk.  
  - Does not overwrite the system clipboard.  
  - Blocks insertion while ChatGPT is generating to avoid interruptions.

- **Undock / Redock**  
  Allows the sidebar to toggle between docked mode and a normal floating window. When re-docked, it restores the saved width.
